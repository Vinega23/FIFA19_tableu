Working environment: Tableau Public

Dataset: data about footballers in the FIFA19 game

Problem: analysis of financial data and skill profiles of footballers in the game

The dataset is based on an already removed set from Kaggle and has been slightly modified to simplify data visualization. 
The dataset consists of two files: fifa_players.csv and fifa_players_statistics.csv. 
In the files, you will find data on footballers in the FIFA19 video game
